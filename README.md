# lockpick_learning_system
***
Python tool to create SVG files for the Longhorn Lockpicking Club /
ACE Academy lockpick learning system.

Lots of improvements to come soon, but for now you run the
lockpick_learning_system.py program, and it reads configuration
information from the file example_locks.csv which can be edited with
pretty much any spreadsheet program.

The program outputs diagrams in SVG format, which you can then print
(using any image editing program that can read SVG, or even a browser)
on a printer, and then trim to the correct size in a laser cutting
machine (or with manually with a paper knife).

The program also outputs diagrams in SVG format that can be used to
drive a laser cutting machine to cut the necessary profiles in plastic
or wood, to be used to hold the locks for practice.
